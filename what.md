* Blaseball is actually a very simple gaming experience.

* Blaseball is a social experiment designed to see what happens when four full time developers have all of their weekends ruined for the rest of their lives.

* Blaseball is kind of like a multimedia equivalent of an exquisite corpse.

* Blaseball strips baseball of its emphasis on competition and reminds us of why we love the game to begin with.

* Blaseball is the closest I've felt to joining a cult in at least two or three years now.
  [Nate Heininger, _The Short Game_, 1:55](http://www.theshortgame.net/240-blaseball/)

* Blaseball is not a game of stasis. It is a game of blood & chaos.

* Blaseball is the best because it's the only sport where I have to look up which player's the dog and which player's the human.

* Blaseball is essentially an absurdist fantasy baseball league where its creators and fans alike collaborate to shape a fictional world. Part game, part social experiment, part existential horror, and entirely bizarre, Blaseball simulates a season of baseball every week at a rate of a game per hour.
  [Carlos Zayas-Pons,_The Paris Review ] (https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/10/23/staff-picks-splorts-seers-and-sentences/)

* What makes Blaseball feel different is that the onus taken by fans to run with the ball is 100% celebrated and supported by the team behind the splort. And that freedom has led the fans to craft something much more organic, rich and unabashedly queer.
