# What is Blaseball?

This project is a list of quotes from people trying to explain what Blaseball is, usually taken out of their original context.

Eventually this will turn into a website where a randomized list of these will show up on your computer.
Then, you can share the experience of not understanding Blaseball with your friends.

*This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.*

## Style and contribution guide

If you have a GitHub account, please feel free to make a pull request modifying [what.md](./what.md).

If you don't have a GitHub account or don't want to send a pull request, send the quote and source to us on Discord (https://discord.gg/F8YSJE6) or Twitter (https://twitter.com/SIBROfficial).

We follow these style guidelines:

* Start the quote with "Blaseball is", even if those words were only implied and not directly said before their definition.
* Provide a link to the story, podcast, tweet, whatever where the source said that.
  The link text should have the person's name and, if on something other than Twitter, the name of the publication.
* Use this format:
```
* Blaseball is actually a very simple gaming experience.
  [Sam Greszes, _Polygon_](https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/8/6/21357131/blaseball-fans-absurd-baseball-sim-the-game-band)
```
* For podcasts and videos, a timestamp is nice, but not required.
* Submit published material written or spoken by someone other than you.
* Good sources are news stories, blog/newsletter posts, or particularly funny tweets. Avoid sending Discord messages or Twitter DMs; if consent to share isn't crystal clear, we won't include it.
* Don't send anything said by someone from The Game Band. They've had a lot of time to think it over and are probably right.
